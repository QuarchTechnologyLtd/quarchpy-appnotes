########### REQUIREMENTS ###########


1- Python (3.x recommended)
    https://www.python.org/downloads/
2- Quarchpy python package
    https://quarch.com/products/quarchpy-python-package/
3- Quarch USB driver (Required for USB connected devices on Windows only)
    https://quarch.com/downloads/driver/
4- Check USB permissions if using Linux:
    https://quarch.com/support/faqs/usb/
5- Java 8, with JaxaFX
    https://quarch.com/support/faqs/java/

########### INSTRUCTIONS ###########

1- Connect a Quarch module to your PC via USB, Serial or LAN and power it on.
2- Run the script and follow the instructions on screen.
3- For localhost QPS, run the example as it is.
4- For remote QPS, comment out the 'startLocalQps()' command and specify the IP:Port in the qpsInterface(...) command
   This can also be used if you want to use a different version of QPS and will run it yourself

    '''
    Example of adding annotations to the trace.  This can be used to highlight events, errors or
    changes from one part of a test to another.
    
    Annotations can be added in real time, or placed anywhere on the trace as part of post-processing,
    using a timestamp.
    
    The following function is used to add an annotation to Quarch Power Studio (QPS). 
    
    def addAnnotation(self,
                  title: str,
                  annotationTime: int | str = 0,
                  extraText: str = "",
                  yPos: int | str = "",
                  titleColor: str = "",
                  annotationColor: str = "",
                  annotationType: str = "",
                  annotationGroup: str = "",
                  timeFormat: str = "unix") -> str
    
    Params:
    title – The primary text label for the annotation.
    annotationTime – Timestamp. Defaults to 0 ("now").
    extraText – Additional text. Defaults to "".
    yPos – Vertical position (0-100). Defaults to "".
    titleColor – Hex color for the title. Defaults to "".
    annotationColor – Hex color for the marker. Defaults to "".
    annotationType – "annotate" or "comment". Defaults to "".
    annotationGroup – Not used. Defaults to "".
    timeFormat – "unix" or "elapsed". Defaults to "unix".
    
    Returns:
    The response message from the QPS device

    time.sleep(1)

    '''
    Example of adding arbitrary data to the trace.  This allows IOPS, Temperature and similar to be added
    where the data may be polled live from another process, or added in post-process.
    
    Channels need a name (T1 in this example) a 'group' name and a unit of measure.
    The final boolean will create auto SI unit ranges (milli/micro...) automatically if set to true.
    
    The following function is used to create a channel in QPS.
    
    def createChannel(self,
                  channelName: str,
                  channelGroup: str,
                  baseUnits: str,
                  usePrefix: bool) -> str
 
    Params:
    channelName – The name for the new channel.
    channelGroup – The group to associate the channel with.
    baseUnits – The fundamental unit for the channel.
    usePrefix – If True, allows channel prefixes.
    
    Returns:
    The response message from the QPS device.
