AN-002 - Simulating physical layer faults

This application note demonstrates the use of a Quarch breaker module to inject standard forms
of physical layer faults onto a high speed data bus such as SAS, SATA or PCIe.

It will work with any quarch breaker module BUT you will have to tweak the signal names
depending on the module you are using as SAS and PCIe use different naming conventions.

The example is also relevant for many other interfaces, such as USB, CAN and RJ-45

This uses the quarchpy python package and demonstrates
- Connecting to a module
- Running a series of fault injections

NOTE: For simplicity, the fault tests are run in sequence.  In the real world, any of the tests might cause
the device under test to reset or fault, so if you are using this against a real device, you should probably 
comment out all but one of the test examples.

This example only creates the fault scenario.  It would be up to you to determine the effect on your device and
if it responded/recovered correctly
