This function demonstrates a very simple module identify, that will work with any Quarch device
We send the command and print the response to the terminal

It first displays the name of the attached module, then cycles between 2 different connections, first with the currently selected connection time,
then with a time of 2x the initial value.  The connection time is the delay between the first connection being removed, and the now one being created.
