Simple example code, specifically targeted at a GEN5 U.2 breaker module (QTL2651)
but could be adapted for any module which supports driving, by selecting
a signal name that is present on your specific module

Uses a 100mS glitch from the glitch engine to combine with the driving feature to drive the PERST signal low for 100mS

it multiple times
