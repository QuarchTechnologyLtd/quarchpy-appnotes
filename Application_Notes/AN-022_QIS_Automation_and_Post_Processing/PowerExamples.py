This example demonstrates basic automation with QIS and post-processing of raw data after recording.
We will record at a high rate and post-process down to a lower rate, ending with 100uS and 500uS sample rates

The resampling implementation is basic and currently coded for a PPM Plus which has a fixed number of
columns in the CSV file.  It could be expanded for a PAM with a higher number of channels.

########### REQUIREMENTS ###########

1- Python 3, a recent version is recommended

2- Quarchpy python package
    https://quarch.com/products/quarchpy-python-package/
3- Quarch USB driver (Required for USB connected devices on windows only)
    https://quarch.com/downloads/driver/
4- Check USB permissions if using Linux:

########### INSTRUCTIONS ###########

1- Connect a Quarch PPM connected to your PC via USB or LAN and power it on
2- Ensure quarcypy is installed
