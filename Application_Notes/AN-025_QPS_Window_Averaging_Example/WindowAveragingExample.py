AN-025 - Application note demonstrating post-processing of Quarch Power Studio (QPS) output

This example demonstrates post-processing calculation of a standard QPS output CSV file, to calculate 
worst case active power consumption, using a user specified averaging window.

########### VERSION HISTORY ########
