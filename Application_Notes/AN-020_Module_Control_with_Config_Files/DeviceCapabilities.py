'''
AN-020 - Application note demonstrating module control with configuration files

This example shows how to use the configuration file data to find the capabilities of a Quarch module.
The script uses the selected module to find the config file and then parses it.
We then print the various sections to the terminal.

########### VERSION HISTORY ###########

19/08/2019 - Andy Norrie    - Initial release
17/03/2023 - Matt Holsey    - Application note reworks

########### REQUIREMENTS ###########

    https://www.python.org/downloads/
2- Quarchpy python package
    https://quarch.com/products/quarchpy-python-package/
3- Quarch USB driver (Required for USB connected devices on windows only)
    https://quarch.com/downloads/driver/
4- Check USB permissions if using Linux:
