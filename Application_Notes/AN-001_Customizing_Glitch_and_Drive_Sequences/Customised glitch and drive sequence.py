'''
AN-001 - Application note demonstrating manual manipulation of signals to create a 
custom glitch/drive event, where precise timing is not critical

This was designed for a QTL1630/QTL1688 PCIe x16 Slot breaker, but can be easily
modified for any breaker by tweaking the signal names used in the script.

In this customer example, there was a requirement to sequence PERST#, SSD +12V and REFCLK. 

This uses the quarchpy python package and demonstrates
- Connecting to a module
- Setting up driving options
- Running a timed sequence to control the signals

########### VERSION HISTORY ###########

    # By default signals transition from plugged (connected) to pulled (isolated).  We can also
    # use 'driving' on breakers that support it.  This allows us to activly drive supported sideband signals
    # ensuring they transition to the state we require.  Here we ensure PERST is pulled down to reset the drive
    # when the switch would otherwise be open:
    # This command drives PERST 'LOW' when the switch is open

    # We want to change the state of all signals on a source at the same time, and with the minimum
    # number of commands, so we avoid any unwanted additional delays. To do this, we use the source 'enable'
    # setting.  When a timed source is turned 'off', the signals assigned to it are pulled (and they are 'plugged'
    # when the source is turned on).  With a few sleep commands, we can create the required event:
    print ("\nRunning the timing sequence, this will take a few seconds...")
    myDevice.sendCommand("source:1:STATE off")
    time.sleep(0.4);

    time.sleep(0.2);
    myDevice.sendCommand("source:1:STATE on")

    # Close the module before we go round the loop to try another test
    # The module should always be closed when you are finished using it
    myDevice.closeConnection()
