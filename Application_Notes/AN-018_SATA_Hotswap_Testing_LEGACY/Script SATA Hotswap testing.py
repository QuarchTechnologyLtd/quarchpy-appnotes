AN-003 - Application note implements the UNH-IOL plugfest test for hotswap of U.2 drives
This application note was written to be used in conjunction with QuarchPy python package and Quarch modules.

########### VERSION HISTORY ###########

05/04/2018 - Andy Norrie    - First version

########### INSTRUCTIONS ###########

1- Connect a Quarch module to your PC via QTL1260 Interface kit and USB cable with the button pushed in
2- If needed, install the FTDI VCOM driver to support the virtual COM port
