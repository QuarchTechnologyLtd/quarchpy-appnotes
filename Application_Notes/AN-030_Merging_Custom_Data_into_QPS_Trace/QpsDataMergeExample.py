AN-030 - Application note demonstrating merging of custom data into a QPS trace

This example is based on our blog: analysing the energy and water consumption of a dishwasher.
This example pulls in custom user data from another source (a water meter in this case) and creates new channels in QPS

It them imports the data into those channels.  Note that the files supplied here will import volume/flow data into
any QPS trace that is at least 10 seconds long.  You can use this as a tool, pick your own qps streams and edit the csv
file or provide your own.

########### VERSION HISTORY ###########

23/04/2024 - Andy Norrie    - First Version
10/12/2024 - Graham Seed    - Use of "$stream import" command to speedup loading CSV data
23/12/2024 - Stuart Boon    - Making the script more generic and providing a qps stream and csv file

########### REQUIREMENTS ##############

1- Python (3.x recommended)
    https://www.python.org/downloads/
2- Quarchpy python package
    https://quarch.com/products/quarchpy-python-package/
3- Quarch USB driver (Required for USB connected devices on Windows only)
    https://quarch.com/downloads/driver/
4- Check USB permissions if using Linux:
    https://quarch.com/support/faqs/usb/
5- Java 8, with JaxaFX
    https://quarch.com/support/faqs/java/

########### INSTRUCTIONS ##############

1- Run the script and follow the instructions on screen.
2- Select your trace when prompted and choose if you want to make a copy to add the data to or add to the original file
3- Select the csv data to add
4- Look at the QPS main chart with the newly added data.
    Try hiding all channels except the newly added ones to see them clearly.
5- End the script and look through the code and comment for a better understandin of how it works.
