AN-014 - Application note demonstration the triggering feature of the breaker

This uses the quarchpy python package and demonstrates
- Scanning for modules
- Connecting to a module
- Runs a simple script for the breaker and PPM, setting up the host power up

'''
Simple script that first configures Breaker to trigger out on 12V Host power event.
Then configures PPM to external trigger. 
PPM also configured to perform glitches on 3v3 upon host power up.
