'''
Part of the Triggering Application Note 

This uses the quarchpy python package and demonstrates
- Scanning for modules
- Connecting to a module
- Runs a simple script for setting PPM to ground upon PERST ASSERT

'''
Simple script that first configures Breaker to trigger out upon power down (PERST).
Then configures PPM to external trigger to set 12V to GND. 
This script can be configured in multiple ways for example to set GND to 12V on PPM once powered up

'''
Function that configures the Breaker to have all signals to be active except of the PERST
When the breaker is pulled then it will send the trigger out to PPM
'''

Function that configures PPM to once the trigger is received to pull 12V to GND
