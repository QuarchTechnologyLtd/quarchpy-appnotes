'''
Part of the Triggering Application Note 

This uses the quarchpy python package and demonstrates
- Scanning for modules
- Connecting to a module
- Runs a simple script for delaying the power rails.

Script that sets 12V and 3v3 power rails to delay each other. To run the specific test scenarios. 
The delay can be configured to suit the customer's requirements.

    '''
    Function that sets all signals to active except of 12V and 3V3 power rails. 
    12V is set to Source 1 and 3v3 to Source 2, meaning the delay can be configured in any way. 
    The delay can be put longer or shorter than 50ms. 
    The delay will happen on the power up.
