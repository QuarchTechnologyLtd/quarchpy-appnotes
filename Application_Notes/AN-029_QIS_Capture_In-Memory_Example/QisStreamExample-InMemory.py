'''
AN-029 - Application note demonstrating control of power modules via QIS and saving the outputted QIS data in-memory

Automating via QIS is a lower overhead that running QPS (Quarch Power Studio) in full but still
provides easy access to data for custom processing.  This example uses quarchpy functions to 
stream data from a quarch power module and dump it into a CSV file.

There are several examples that run in series, these can be commented out if you want to simplify the actions:

simpleStreamExample() - This example streams data to a python data structure


QIS is distributed as part of the Quarchpy python package and does not require seperate install

########### VERSION HISTORY ###########

15/10/2018 - Pedro Cruz     - First Version
12/05/2012 - Matt Holsey    - Bug fixed - check stream is stopped before continuing with script
25/01/2023 - Andy Norrie    - Updated and reviewed for latest feature set and best practice

########### REQUIREMENTS ###########

1- Python (3.x recommended)
    https://www.python.org/downloads/
2- Java 8, with JaxaFX
    https://quarch.com/support/faqs/java/
3- Quarchpy python package
    https://quarch.com/products/quarchpy-python-package/
4- Quarch USB driver (Required for USB connected devices on windows only)
    https://quarch.com/downloads/driver/
5- Check USB permissions if using Linux:
    https://quarch.com/support/faqs/usb/

########### INSTRUCTIONS ###########

1. Connect a PPM/PAM device via USB or LAN and power it up
2. Run the script and follow any instructions on the terminal
