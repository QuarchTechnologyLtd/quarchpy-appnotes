AN-012 - Application note demonstrating control of power modules via QIS

Automating via QIS is a lower overhead that running QPS (Quarch Power Studio) in full but still
provides easy access to data for custom processing.  This example uses quarchpy functions to 
stream data from a quarch power module and dump it into a CSV file.

In this example we find and connect to an instrument.  We then record a short period of data
to file in CSV format.  The stream process is repeated twice, at different averaging rates,
so you can see the difference in file size and understand how to capture multiple streams in series.

module.startStream() is non-blocking, so you can continue to run your own commands/scripts
while the stream is recording in the background.  You can also connect to multiple modules
simultaneously and start them streaming in parallel, each to a different file, with multiple
calls to module1.startStream(), module2.startStream(), etc.

########### REQUIREMENTS ###########

1- Python 3, a recent version is recommended
    https://www.python.org/downloads/
2- Quarchpy python package
    https://quarch.com/products/quarchpy-python-package/
3- Quarch USB driver (Required for USB connected devices on windows only)
    https://quarch.com/downloads/driver/
4- Check USB permissions if using Linux:
    https://quarch.com/support/faqs/usb/

########### INSTRUCTIONS ###########

1. Connect a PPM/PAM device via USB or LAN and power it up
2. Run the script and follow any instructions on the terminal
